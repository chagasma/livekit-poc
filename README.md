# livekit-poc

A proof of concept for LiveKit Voice AI Agent implementation.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

3. Download model files (one-time setup):

```bash
uv run src/main.py download-files
```

## Running the Agent

### Development Mode

Runs the agent and connects to LiveKit Cloud, waiting for web/mobile app connections:

```bash
uv run src/main.py dev
```

### Console Mode

Runs the agent locally with terminal interface for testing. Requires PortAudio for microphone input:

```bash
# Install PortAudio first (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev

# Run console mode:
uv run src/main.py console
```

In console mode:

- Press `Ctrl+B` to toggle between Text/Audio mode
- Press `Q` to quit
